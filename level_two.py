        LEVEL 2: THE BISHOP'S ASCENT 
    ──────────────────────────────────

    The battlefield is no longer a chaotic mess of warriors clashing head-on.  
    It is a game of sight, angles, and precision. You have been chosen for  
    the **Bishop's Path**, a warrior of foresight and deadly accuracy.  

    "Patience and wisdom will guide your blade," whispers the High Priest.

    You are no longer bound to a single step forward. You now move  
    **diagonally across the battlefield**, cutting through enemy lines  
    with speed and grace.

    ⚔️ **New Movement Abilities:**
      * The Bishop moves **one step diagonally** per turn.
      * You must think ahead—your path is limited, but your strategy is key.
      * Enemies lurk in the shadows. Position yourself wisely to survive.

    The path to mastery is not about speed—it is about **seeing what others do not**.  
    Adapt, or be eliminated.

    LEVEL 2 TRAINING

    As a **bishop**, your movement is now limited to the color of your starting square.  
    If you begin on a **dark square**, you will always remain on dark squares.  
    If you start on a **light square**, you will always move on light squares.

        └───────────────────────────┘

    ⚔️ **Movement Rules:**
      * You can only travel on **your color** (dark or light).
      * No jumping over obstacles.
      * Capture enemies by stepping onto their position.

    **Training Drill:**
      - Try moving **diagonally** to an empty square of your color.
      - Capture the target dummy placed diagonally from you.
      - Be mindful of the battlefield—some paths may be blocked.

    **The battlefield rewards wisdom over speed.**  
    Master your movement, and you will survive.

    MISSION: FIND THE SPY
    ─────────────────────

    Your mission, brave soldier, is to uncover the traitor among your ranks —the spy. 
    The spy has been planting ambushes all over the land to trap unsuspecting soldiers like you. 
    Your goal is to navigate the battlefield, avoiding traps, and figure out who the spy is. 

    The spy could be anyone. Look for unusual patterns in their movement.

    Here are your instructions:

    1. Move with caution: The land is dangerous, and ambushes lie hidden. 
       Watch your surroundings carefully and move one step at a time.
    2. Spy Indicators: Keep an eye on any strange behavior, like soldiers moving away 
    from their posts or odd paths that don't align with normal patrol routes.
    3. Avoid Ambushes: You may stumble upon traps. If you suspect a trap, don't engage immediately. 
        Look for safer paths and be cautious when moving into enemy territory.
    4. **Find the Spy**: Use your instincts to determine who among your allies may be the spy. 
       They might try to blend in but their actions will give them away.

    !Warning: The spy may also attempt to mislead you by feigning innocence. 

    Once you believe you've identified the spy, report back to your commander. 
    If you're wrong, the enemy might use your mistake against you.
