       🔥 LEVEL 2: THE BISHOP'S ASCENT 🔥
    ───────────────────────────────────────

    The battlefield is no longer a chaotic mess of warriors clashing head-on.  
    It is a game of sight, angles, and precision. You have been chosen for  
    the **Bishop's Path**, a warrior of foresight and deadly accuracy.  

    "Patience and wisdom will guide your blade," whispers the High Priest.

    You are no longer bound to a single step forward. You now move  
    **diagonally across the battlefield**, cutting through enemy lines  
    with speed and grace.

    ⚔️ **New Movement Abilities:**
      🔹 The Bishop moves **one step diagonally** per turn.
      🔹 You must think ahead—your path is limited, but your strategy is key.
      🔹 Enemies lurk in the shadows. Position yourself wisely to survive.

    The path to mastery is not about speed—it is about **seeing what others do not**.  
    Adapt, or be eliminated.

    ➡️ Press ENTER to begin your trial...
