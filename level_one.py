    ───────────────────────────────────────

    The battlefield is a chaotic mess of broken weapons, fallen soldiers, and
    the distant sound of war drums. You, a mere pawn, stand among the ranks,
    gripping your sword tightly. The enemy lines stretch before you, but
    beyond them lies a chance for greatness.

    "Keep moving forward! No turning back!" yells your commander.

    Your mission is simple: Reach the enemy's last row and earn your promotion.

    However, the battlefield is dangerous. Enemy pawns will try to stop you,
    and the terrain itself is full of obstacles.

    * Move wisely. Your life depends on it.
    * Watch out for enemy ambushes.
    * Reach the 8th rank to achieve greatness!

    ➡️ Press ENTER to begin your journey...

      greatness.
